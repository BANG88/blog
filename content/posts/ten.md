> 10 年回顾

2011 年的 5.1 拖着行李箱，乘坐绿皮车从南宁来到广州 - 历时 12 小时，从此并走上了开发这条不归路。

<div><audio src="/media/audio/不羁的风.flac" controls /></div>

我可能跟大部分同学一样，对自己的未来都是没有规划的，走到哪算哪的那种。学校学的基本都是非常浅的入门篇，
而且也没怎么学。那会做 asp.net 的比较多，因为有控件比较容易上手，所以刚开始也是做网站，卖模板的也多，哈哈哈。

那会还没有前端，只有切图仔，以网页三剑客谋生。

## 前尘往事

10 年前的某一天，少年听说现在有一个很专业的职位，只需负责前台的展示以及交互部分，也就是还原设计稿，不需要写后台代码。
要求具有良好的前瞻性，对设计敏感，能原样输出设计稿为 html 网页，会简单的 js **特效**。 眼里有光（发亮的那种光 - 。 -，
但是自己几斤几两还是很清楚的，不知道如何用原生 js 操作`dom`，听说还有一种 叫 `AJAX` 的技术，也不知道是啥玩意。

几天折腾后发现一个叫 jQuery 的框架，不需要写原生 js 就可以操作 dom，有动画也有$.ajax 封装，简直是神器了。网上搜了一下，有一本
锋利的 jQuery 的书评分挺高的，于是马上从 Amazon 下单了一本。拿到书后挺开心的，很薄。没多久就翻完了，这是我第一次认真看完一本书，
而且从书中收获最多的一次。

凭借着这点基础就去找了一份专职的前端工作了，因为对 jQuery 的 api 相对来说挺熟悉的（很认真的看了好几遍书，边看边练习），用起来也挺顺手，
对大部分业务也都能用 jQuery 搞定，后面又有了 jQuery UI，所以相对来说事情倒简单了不少。

开始真正的前端开发了，这得谢谢我的第一个东家。在里面 3 年的时间里，我用每个月公司补贴的钱全部买书了。这三年是我成长中
最重要的三年，为以后打下了坚实的基础。

```js

  var hiddenBox = $("#banner-message");
  $("#button-container button").on("click", function (event) {
    hiddenBox.show();
  });
});
```

_Write less,do more._

A similar conflict emerged after the invention of the first printing press in Europe. Johannes Gutenberg invented movable type and used it to produce different compositions. His workshop could print up to 240 impressions per hour. Until then, the books were being copied by hand. All the books were handwritten and decorated with hand drawn ornaments and figures. A process of copying a book was long but each book, even a copy, was a work of art.

The first printed books were, at first, perceived as inferior to the handwritten ones. They were smaller and cheaper to produce. Movable type provided the printers with flexibility that allowed them to print books in languages other than Latin. Gill describes the transition to industrialism as something that people needed and wanted. Something similar happened after the first printed books emerged. People wanted books in a language they understood and they wanted books they could take with them. They were hungry for knowledge and printed books satisfied this hunger.

![ten.jpg](/media/ten.jpg)

_The 42–Line Bible, printed by Gutenberg._

But, through this transition, the book lost a large part of its humanity. The machine took over most of the process but craftsmanship was still a part of it. The typefaces were cut manually by the first punch cutters. The paper was made by hand. The illustrations and ornaments were still being hand drawn. These were the remains of the craftsmanship that went almost extinct in the times of Eric Gill.

## The digital age

The first transition took away a large part of humanity from written communication. Industrialisation, the second transition described by Eric Gill, took away most of what was left. But it’s the third transition that stripped it naked. Typefaces are faceless these days. They’re just fonts on our computers. Hardly anyone knows their stories. Hardly anyone cares. Flicking through thousands of typefaces and finding the “right one” is a matter of minutes.

> In the new computer age the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of visual pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic ones, and trash the rest.
>
> — Massimo Vignelli

Typography is not about typefaces. It’s not about what looks best, it’s about what feels right. What communicates the message best. Typography, in its essence, is about the message. “Typographical design should perform optically what the speaker creates through voice and gesture of his thoughts.”, as El Lissitzky, a famous Russian typographer, put it.

## Loss of humanity through transitions

Each transition took away a part of humanity from written language. Handwritten books being the most humane form and the digital typefaces being the least. Overuse of Helvetica is a good example. Messages are being told in a typeface just because it’s a safe option. It’s always there. Everyone knows it but yet, nobody knows it. Stop someone on the street and ask him what Helvetica is? Ask a designer the same question. Ask him where it came from, when, why and who designed it. Most of them will fail to answer these questions. Most of them used it in their precious projects but they still don’t spot it in the street.

Typefaces don’t look handmade these days. And that’s all right. They don’t have to. Industrialism took that away from them and we’re fine with it. We’ve traded that part of humanity for a process that produces more books that are easier to read. That can’t be bad. And it isn’t.

> Humane typography will often be comparatively rough and even uncouth; but while a certain uncouthness does not seriously matter in humane works, uncouthness has no excuse whatever in the productions of the machine.
>
> — Eric Gill

We’ve come close to “perfection” in the last five centuries. The letters are crisp and without rough edges. We print our compositions with high–precision printers on a high quality, machine made paper.

![type-through-time.jpg](/media/type-through-time.jpg)

_Type through 5 centuries._

We lost a part of ourselves because of this chase after perfection. We forgot about the craftsmanship along the way. And the worst part is that we don’t care. The transition to the digital age made that clear. We choose typefaces like clueless zombies. There’s no meaning in our work. Type sizes, leading, margins… It’s all just a few clicks or lines of code. The message isn’t important anymore. There’s no more “why” behind the “what”.

## Chasing perfection

Human beings aren’t perfect. Perfection is something that will always elude us. There will always be a small part of humanity in everything we do. No matter how small that part, we should make sure that it transcends the limits of the medium. We have to think about the message first. What typeface should we use and why? Does the typeface match the message and what we want to communicate with it? What will be the leading and why? Will there be more typefaces in our design? On what ground will they be combined? What makes our design unique and why? This is the part of humanity that is left in typography. It might be the last part. Are we really going to give it up?
